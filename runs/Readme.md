These are the two input files (\*.inp) used for model runs 43 and 44 in paper. Also included are the slurm scripts used to submit jobs to an HPC cluster as well as the Tecplot files (\*.lay and \*.lpk) used to visualize model output. The \*.lay files require that the model be run to generate the outputs, but the \*.lpk do include the model data packaged in the tecplot file.
